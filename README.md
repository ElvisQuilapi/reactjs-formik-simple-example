# Reactjs Boilerplate Custom

Hello, a few days ago I was asking how to start doing a project in reaction, but without the default boilerplate that we always occupy. So looking for information through the network I could get to configure something that works, I am not saying that it is perfect but you can raise the project and compile the production code.
